# PDS-Project Phase 1


## Testcase
There is no VHDL format for each module to write the project, and the name and input of the modules can be customized. The input content of each module is shared. Use Module 3 output for Module 4 inputs.
The inputs contained in this folder contain the contents of the various matrices we need.
Consider value of R constant equal to 7 and value of L equal to 13.
Size of Matrix A11 is 7X7.

## Submission 
For each module, one or more descriptive files, a test file, and the output content produced must be submitted. Put each module in its folder. If you need a description for each section, put a file with Radme in the module folder.
