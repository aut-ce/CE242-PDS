### How to complete Lab course as good student
[1] Clone repository to own account.

[2] Don't upload your codes in public domain.

[3] Update cloned branch for new assignments template
* Add the remote, call it "upstream":
* `git remote add upstream https://github.com/aut-ce/CE242-PDS`
* `git fetch upstream`
* `git checkout main`
* `git rebase upstream/main`

[4] Create new branch for assignments (`git branch ca-lab-xx`)

[5] commit your codes in branch (`git add lab-xx & git commit`)

[6] set branch remote to private repository like CEIT Gitlab or new private fork on GitHub (`git push -u https://git.ce.aut.ac.ir/XYZ lab-xx`)

[7] after passing the course, add your id and semester in last line of [**who-had-pds-at-aut.md**](https://github.com/aut-ce/CE242-PDS/tree/main/who-had-pds-at-aut.md) file by pull request.
